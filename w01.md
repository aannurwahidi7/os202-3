# Top 10 List of Week 01


1. [Open Source Software and Free Sofrware](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/index.html)<br>
[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (sometimes referred to as free/libre
software) not only makes source code available but also is licensed to allow
no-cost use, redistribution, and modification. [Open-source] (https://opensource.org/osd) software does
not necessarily offer such licensing. Thus, although all free software is open
source, some open-source software is not “free.” 

2. [System Call](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/index.html)<br>
System calls provide an interface to the services made available by an operating system. 
These calls are generally available as functions written in C and
C++, although certain low-level tasks (for example, tasks where hardware
must be accessed directly) may have to be written using assembly-language
instructions.

3. [GNU/Linux, what is that?](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/ch01s02.en.html)<br>
Linux is an operating system based on UNIX; as an operating system, Linux is
a series of programs that let you interact with your computer and run other programs.
In a GNU/Linux system, Linux is the kernel component. 
The rest of the system consists of other programs, many of which were written by or 
for the GNU Project. Because the Linux kernel alone does not form a working operating system, 
we prefer to use the term “GNU/Linux” to refer to systems that many people casually refer to as “Linux”.

4. [Here's What You Need to Know about Linux](https://hackernoon.com/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-linux-a7de13769a74)<br>
I found this interesting article about someone who learnt about Linux, and then he got so enthusiastic
about learning how does computer works. This artice summarize important things about Linux. Just click the
title of this section to checkout the article.

5. [Kernel](https://nuxid.com/2017/09/23/apa-itu-kernel-apa-hubungannya-dengan-linux/)<br>
The kernel is a program which is the core of an operating system. 
The kernel has complete control over everything that goes on in the system.

6. [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/)<br>
The window, which is usually called the command line or command-line interface, 
is a text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. 
It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical interface. 
Other names for the command line are: cmd, CLI, prompt, console or terminal.
This article also showed us about the basics command for MacOS, Windows, and Linux in the CLI.

7. [Basic VI Commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
The default editor that comes with the UNIX operating system is called vi (visual editor).
Understands the commands in VI editor absolutely help us to write in VI editor with CLI.
I got the article from [https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/Welcome2GNULinux.html](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/Welcome2GNULinux.html).

8. [Virtualization and Operating-System Components](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/index.html)
Operating-System aspects of virtualization including how the VMM provides core operating-system function
like scheduling, I/O, and memory management. Read more in Chapter 18.6, it's really interesting!

9. [VirtualOS and Reasons to Start using Virtual Machine](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-start-using-virtual-machine/)<br>
The virtual OS thinks that it's running on a real system, but it runs just like any other app on your computer.
The article's made me aware of the reasons why we used virtual box in this course. Of course,
it also allows us to explore more Operating System with our laptop.

10. [Cloud Computing and Why?](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/index.html)<br>
Cloud computing is a type of computing that delivers computing, storage,
and even applications as a service across a network. In some ways, it’s a
logical extension of virtualization, because it uses virtualization as a base for
its functionality. Types of cloud computing: public, private, hybrid SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.
