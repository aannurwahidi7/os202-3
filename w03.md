# Top 10 List of Week 03
Source: Mostly from OSC 10th Edition

1. [What is file?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1)<br>
A file is an abstract data type defined and implemented by the operating
system. It is a sequence of logical records. A logical record may be a byte,
a line (of fixed or variable length), or a more complex data item. The
operating system may specifically support various record types or may
leave that support to the application program.

2. [File System, Single-Level and Two-Level Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2)<br>
Within a file system, it is useful to create directories to allow files to be
organized. A single-level directory in a multiuser system causes naming
problems, since each file must have a unique name. A two-level directory
solves this problem by creating a separate directory for each user’s files.
The directory lists the files by name and includes the file’s location on the
disk, length, type, owner, time of creation, time of last use, and so on.

3. [Generalization of Two Level Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3)<br>
The natural generalization of a two-level directory is a tree-structured
directory. A tree-structured directory allows a user to create subdirectories
to organize files. Acyclic-graph directory structures enable users to share
subdirectories and files but complicate searching and deletion. A general
graph structure allows complete flexibility in the sharing of files and directories but sometimes requires garbage collection to recover unused disk
space.

4. [Remote File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4)<br>
Remote file systems present challenges in reliability, performance, and
security. Distributed information systems maintain user, host, and access
information so that clients and servers can share state information to manage use and access.

5. [Apple File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5)<br>
Apple File System (APFS) is a good example of such a design. Its goal
is to run on all current Apple devices, from the Apple Watch through the
iPhone to the Mac computers. Creating a file system that works in watchOS,
I/Os, tvOS, and macOS is certainly a challenge. APFS is feature-rich, including
64-bit pointers, clones for files and directories, snapshots, space sharing, fast
directory sizing, atomic safe-save primitives, copy-on-write design, encryption (single- and multi-key), and I/O coalescing. It understands NVM as well
as HDD storage

6. [Directory Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6)<br>
Directory-management routines must consider efficiency, performance,
and reliability. A hash table is a commonly used method, as it is fast and
efficient. Unfortunately, damage to the table or a system crash can result in
inconsistency between the directory information and the disk’s contents.

7. [Free Space Allocation Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7)<br>
Free-space allocation methods also influence the efficiency of disk-space
use, the performance of the file system, and the reliability of secondary
storage. The methods used include bit vectors and linked lists. Optimizations include grouping, counting, and the FAT, which places the linked list
in one contiguous area.

8. [What should be considered in directory-management routines?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)<br>
Directory-management routines must consider efficiency, performance,
and reliability. A hash table is a commonly used method, as it is fast and
efficient. Unfortunately, damage to the table or a system crash can result in
inconsistency between the directory information and the disk’s contents.
